# SQL Data Analysis Projects

## 1. Porter Data Analysis using SQL

### SQL Insights & Actions

#### Revenue Segmentation by Customer Behavior
**Insights:**
- Certain customer types (e.g., "Corporate Clients" or "Frequent Users") contribute disproportionately to revenue.
- The average revenue per booking is highest for "Corporate Clients," while individual customers account for most bookings.

**Actions:**
1. Introduce tiered rewards for frequent individual users.
2. Expand corporate partnerships for stable revenue streams.
3. Offer premium services to high-value customer segments.

#### Impact of Vehicle Type on Delivery Times
**Insights:**
- "Two-Wheelers" have the shortest average delivery times but generate lower revenue.
- Larger vehicles take longer for deliveries but serve high-revenue clients.

**Actions:**
1. Use smaller vehicles for short-distance, high-density urban areas.
2. Adjust pricing based on vehicle type to balance delivery cost and profitability.
3. Leverage AI to assign vehicles dynamically based on traffic, weather, and distance.

#### Customer Retention Analysis
**Insights:**
- Customers with higher retention periods tend to spend more consistently.
- Most new customers churn after one or two bookings.

**Actions:**
1. Offer discounts for first-time users to encourage repeat bookings.
2. Use CRM tools to send reminders, offers, or follow-ups for inactive customers.
3. Introduce subscription services for frequent users.

#### Cancellation Trends and Reasons
**Insights:**
- Cancellations are higher during peak traffic and adverse weather conditions.
- "Delay in Delivery" is the most common reason for cancellations.

**Actions:**
1. Use real-time updates to manage customer expectations.
2. Allow customers to reschedule without penalty during peak conditions.
3. Reward drivers for timely deliveries to reduce cancellations.

#### Delivery Bottleneck Analysis
**Insights:**
- Traffic congestion and bad weather significantly impact delivery times.
- Failed bookings spike during specific time windows (e.g., rush hours).

**Actions:**
1. Implement surge pricing during peak hours to manage demand.
2. Adjust delivery slots based on traffic patterns.
3. Collaborate with local authorities to address urban traffic challenges.

#### Driver Efficiency Metrics
**Insights:**
- Drivers with high ratings are 15-20% faster and contribute to higher customer satisfaction.
- Unrated drivers tend to have a higher rate of failed or delayed deliveries.

**Actions:**
1. Provide training to unrated or low-rated drivers.
2. Incentivize drivers with high ratings and consistent on-time deliveries.
3. Assign experienced drivers to critical routes during peak hours.

#### Revenue Leak Analysis
**Insights:**
- Failed bookings account for a significant portion of potential revenue loss.
- Low booking value trips have a higher likelihood of failure.

**Actions:**
1. Introduce a minimum revenue threshold for orders.
2. Use predictive models to allocate resources to higher-value bookings.

#### Dynamic Pricing Opportunities
**Insights:**
- Revenue per booking is higher during specific time slots (e.g., late evenings).
- Certain locations consistently generate higher revenue.

**Actions:**
1. Charge premiums in high-revenue areas.
2. Promote specific delivery windows with incentives to optimize fleet usage.
3. Target low-revenue time slots with discounts.
